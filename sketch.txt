# 1. k-gram math stuff
- function to calculate the number of occurances of each k-gram
    - argument should prolly be the input as string
    - looping through each character (maybe doesnt have to be every c at the end) of the input text and 
      store it in some kind of Counter() object (look up)
    - maybe there is a way to store the locations of each k_gram in this so the next function doesnt need 
      to seek again?
- function to calculate the number of times, character c follows k_gram w
    - argument char c and float k_gram
    - some kind of find-logic for the k_gram and then check input[i+k+1]
-> function to calculate the the conditional probability
    - arguments string k_gram and char c return n(w,c)/n(w,*)
